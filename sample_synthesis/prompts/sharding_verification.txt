You are given an instruction that fully specifies a problem, and a list of shards. Your task is to decide whether all the information from the full instruction is captured by the shards.

If not, you should output the information unit from the instruction that is not captured by the shards.

Example 1:

Instruction:
What are the names and locations of the stadiums that had concerts that occurred in both 2014 and 2015?

Shards:
{"shards": [{"shard_id": 1, "shard": "I'm looking for active stadiums"}, {"shard_id": 2, "shard": "the stadiums should have concerts during a period"}, {"shard_id": 3, "shard": "the concerts should have occurred in both 2014 and 2015"}, {"shard_id": 4, "shard": "for the stadiums, returned both the name and location"}]}

Output:
{"converage": "complete"}


Example 2:
Instruction:
Which Asian countries have a population that is larger than any country in Africa?

Shards:
{"shards": [{"shard_id": 1, "shard": "I'm interested in learning about countries in Asia"}, {"shard_id": 2, "shard": "consider the population size of these Asian countries"}, {"shard_id": 3, "shard": "the population should be compared in size"}, {"shard_id": 4, "shard": "specifically, compare to the population of African countries"}]}

Output:
{"coverage": "incomplete", "missing_segment": "the shards do not specify that the population of the Asian countries should be *larger* than the population of any African countries"}



You must output in JSON format as shown in the examples above.
Now complete the task for the following fully specified instruction and shards:

Instruction:
[[QUERY]]

Shards:
[[SHARDS]]
