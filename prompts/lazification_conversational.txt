You are given segments of a fully specified instruction, and your task is to: (1) choose one that will be the initial shard of a multi-step query, and then (2) rephrase each segment into a conversational version that are provided to the system in a follow-up turn of the conversation.

Your output should be a JSON object in the following format:
{
    "initial_segment": "[exact excerpt from the instruction]",
    "initial_shard": "conversational version of the initial segment",
    "shards": [
    {"segment": "[exact excerpt from the instruction]", "shard": "conversational version of the segment taking the rest of the instruction into account"}
    ]
}

Example:

Full Query:
What are the names and locations of the stadiums that had concerts that occurred in both 2014 and 2015?

Segments:
[
    {"segment": "names and locations"},
    {"segment": "stadiums"},
    {"segment": "concerts"},
    {"segment": "in both 2014"},
    {"segment": "and 2015"}
]

Output:
{
    "initial_segment": "stadiums",
    "initial_shard": "popular stadiums",
    "shards": [
        {"segment": "concerts", "shard": "the stadiums should have concerts during a period"},
        {"segment": "in both 2014", "shard": "the concerts should have occurred in 2014 in the stadiums"},
        {"segment": "and 2015", "shard": "the concerts should have also occurred in 2015 in the same stadiums"},
        {"segment": "names and locations", "shard": "for the stadiums, returned both the name and location"}
    ]
}

Rules:
- [Transform each segment] Make sure each segment is included either as the initial shard or in the rest of the shards. Do not forget any segments.
- [Short initial shard] Make the initial shard short, not a full sentence, similar to how users use a search engine like Google.
- [Order of shards] Order the shards in order of importance, from most to least important to the initial shard. You do not need to keep the order the segments that are provided in.

Now complete the task for the following fully specified instruction and segments:

Fully Specified Instruction:
[[QUESTION]]

Segments:
[[SEGMENTS]]
