You are given [[N_DOCS]] conversations within the following scenario: "[[TOPIC]]".
In each conversation, the participants might be different, with different names, but all the conversations fall into the same scenario.

```
[[DOCUMENTS]]
```

Your objective is to produce a summary of all the document with [[N_INSIGHTS]] bullet points covering the main insights regarding the following query: [[QUERY]].
Careful:
- [Format] You should format your summary as a bullet point list, where each bullet point is a different insight.
- [References] For each insight, you should refer to the relevant conversations by using the IDs given in the conversation list. For example: "some of the doctors ask patients for their medical history[1][4]" which means that the insight is supported by Document 1 and Document 4. No need to say "Conversation 14", you can just use the following structure: "[14]".
- [Length] Your summary should be no longer than 300 words in total.
