Your goal is to extract verbatim what the answer is. The answer to the user query is expected to be: [[ANSWER_DESCRIPTION]]

- [Exact Answer Only] only extract the exact answer, and nothing else (including ``` for code blocks, or intro/outro text).
- [Verbatim Only] Only extract verbatim text, do not modify the text in any way. If there's a typo, an error, you must absoltutely include it, and not correct it in any way. The program will check that the string you extract is exactly present as a substringz in the passage provided.
- [String output] the <answer_str> must be a string, not a number and not a dictionary.
