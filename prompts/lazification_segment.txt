You are a given a fully specified instruction, and your task is to segment the instruction into a units of information that each reveal a single piece of information of the instruction.
You must output a list of segments in the following JSON format:
[
    {"segment": "[exact excerpt from the instruction]"},
    {"segment": "[exact excerpt from the instruction]"},
    ...
]

Rules:
- [Non-overlapping] The segments must be non-overlapping and cover the entire instruction. You can optionally leave some gaps for non-essential portions of the original instruction (delimiters, headers, etc.)
- [Minimalistic] You should split the information in the segments to as small as possible. If you have a compound expression (X and Y), you should split it into two segments. Each segment should represent a unit of information.

Example Query:
What are the names and locations of the stadiums that had concerts that occurred in both 2014 and 2015?

Output:
{"segments": [
    {"segment": "names and locations"},
    {"segment": "stadiums"},
    {"segment": "concerts"},
    {"segment": "in both 2014"},
    {"segment": "and 2015"}
]}

Now complete the task for the following fully specified instruction:
